		"longDescription": "Aurelius is a sophisticated dimout curtain collection crafted for optimal light control and aesthetic refinement. Made from a plain weave blend of polyester and cotton with fine chenille yarns, it offers a dry, lightly textured surface and a subtle two-tone effect that enhances interior softness. The fabric's generous 300cm continuous width is ideal for seamless drapery applications, making it perfect for larger installations such as full-length curtains, Roman blinds, and soft furnishings like cushions and lampshades. With 16 curated colours, including classic neutrals like Snow, Vanilla, Ecru, and Pumice, as well as deeper tones like Pebble and Shadow, and muted accents such as Sage and Blush, Aurelius balances utility with style. The Oeko Tex certification ensures the fabric meets stringent safety and environmental standards, appealing to health-conscious environments.\n\nAurelius is particularly well-suited for S-fold curtains, offering key functional attributes such as wave consistency, fluid drape, stackability, and soft movement along ceiling-mounted or track systems. The fabric's compatibility with S-fold and wave-style curtains is enhanced by its ripple fold, flowing pleats, continuous fabric, and track-mounted headings. Additionally, Aurelius is versatile enough for other curtain styles, including double pinch pleat, triple pinch pleat, and pencil pleat, with features like tailored folds, pleat definition, and gathered headings. It can be used on traditional track or pole-mounted systems, making it an excellent choice for modern living spaces and commercial environments requiring reduced light transmission with elevated visual comfort.",
