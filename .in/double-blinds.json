This practical and versatile system is ideal for modern living spaces, offices and shared areas where adaptable coverage is essential.\n\nThe Metro light filtering fabric gently diffuses incoming sunlight, reducing glare while maintaining a level of daytime privacy. It allows natural light to brighten the room without the intensity of direct sun, making it well suited to areas where comfort and visibility are important.\n\nIn the evening or when full privacy is required, the Linesque blockout layer delivers complete light exclusion. Constructed from 100% polyester with an acrylic coating, this durable fabric has a substantial weight of 431gsm and a nominal thickness of 0.65mm. It is PVC and lead free, rated for high tear resistance, and features strong light fastness (Blue Scale 6). Compliant with the Building Code of Australia for class 2 to 9(a) buildings and fire tested to AS 1530 Part III, it also holds Greenguard Gold certification, making it suitable for sensitive environments such as schools and healthcare settings.\n\nBoth fabrics are flame retardant, easy to clean and designed for long-term use. Suitable for window widths up to 3000mm and compatible with both manual and motorised operation, this dual blind system offers a clean, modern solution for effective light management.",
