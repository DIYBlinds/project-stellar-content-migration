With a fabric weight of 400gsm, a thickness of 0.57mm, and an openness factor of 5—8% (colour dependent), it ensures excellent light control while preserving outdoor views. The 3,000mm width is ideal for wide windows and sliding doors, providing smooth operation and a contemporary appearance. The Ice variant achieves 26% visual light transmission and 67% solar reflectance under EN 410 testing. Flame retardant to meet Australian standards (Class 2—9), it is easy to clean with warm soapy water and a damp cloth. This practical choice offers controlled daylight and solar management, UV protection, and privacy. Compatible with blockout, sunscreen, or light-filtering fabrics, it features a track-mounted design with wand or motorised operation. Perfect for window treatments, sliding panel systems, and interior shading, it embodies minimalist design and thermal efficiency, appealing to homeowners, designers, and specifiers.",
